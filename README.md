# Shadows of Infinity

## _Exploring the Mystical Depths of Fractals_

---

### About the Project

**Shadows of Infinity** is a console application dedicated to rendering the complex and captivating world of fractals. This project is a journey through mathematical beauty, offering stunning visualizations of the Mandelbrot and Buddhabrot sets.

---

### Features

- **Mandelbrot Set Rendering:** Dive into the intricate patterns of the Mandelbrot set, a symbol of the mysterious and recursive nature of fractals.

- **Buddhabrot Set Rendering:** Experience the Buddhabrot, a unique and spiritual representation that brings a new perspective to fractal visualization.

- **Console-based Visualization:** Leveraging the power of console applications for an elegant and efficient rendering experience.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Tailor your fractal exploration with adjustable settings for depth, color, and scale.

### Continued Research

    Remove samples from the main Cariods
    Update colorization with R = 500 G = 5000 B = 50000

    iteration time i exceeds some minimum iteration time k with k < n. For example, you could use k = 1000 and n = 10000, i.e. keep only those samples that do not escape before their 1000th iteration but do escape before their 10000th iteration.
